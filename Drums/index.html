          <h2>Component Details</h2>
          <p>
            The percussion function uses a combination of functions to
            manipulate a waveform via arithmetically adding/multiplying each output.
            This allows sound generation to be executed during play time, rather
            than calling in a wavetable with preset values. Such functions are
            separated into <strong>four groups:</strong>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Note: Reson filter functions are not included in this listing since
            these functions were borrowed from subtractive:
            <ul>
              <li>Adders, returns wave values:</li>
              <li>Sinewave</li>
              <li>Squarewave</li>
              <li>Saw wave</li>
              <li>Trianglewave</li>
              <li>Sinenoise* (experimental)</li>
              <li>Multipliers, returns amplitude values: (note: each ADSR element calls Fader)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Fader (which increments/decrements the sounds amplitude)</li>
                <li>Attack</li>
                <li>Decay</li>
                <li>Sustain</li>
                <li>Release</li>
              </ul>
              <li>ADSR (combination of each ADSR function above)</li>
              <li>Noise, returns random values from -1 to 1: ○ Whitenoise</li>
              <li>Pitch Changer, void function that changes m_pitch: ○ Changepitch</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Each can then be varied with time to create various percussion sounds.
            To vary the times when a function is called, each function obtains a
            start and stop time value where if m_time is within that timeframe,
            the function will give a output corresponding to that function. If
            m_time is not in the timeframe, the function will return either: 0
            for adders, 1 for multipliers/noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            ADSR also has four time values, m_atime, m_dtime, m_stime,
            and m_rtime, which sets the times where each element from
            ADSR can be used. ADSR also has two amplitude values, m_aamp and
            m_samp, which determines the amplitudes of the points in between
            AD and SR respectively. A couple useful function parameters would
            be m_amult, which varies the amplitude of the outputs for adder
            functions, and m_pmult, which varies pitch for adder functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other functions include Whitenoise and Changepitch. Whitenoise is
            used in conjunction with the snare drums and the highhat to properly
            simulate their sounds. Whitenoise also utilizes a reson filter so it
            may scale with pitch. Changepitch is used for swept fundamentals. This
            can be used to both simulate how vibrations in snares/toms/kicks drop
            over time and for other fun effects.

          <h2>Playing a sound</h2>
          <p>
            For a percussion sound to be played, the XML file should first indicate
            that the instrument="Drums" and the type of percussion to be played
            within each note (ex: type="snare01"). When the function is called,
            an if/else chain is used to select which instrument. On the first frame
            and only the first frame, default values are each ADSR time/amp is set,
            as well as the default pitch.
          </p>

          <p>
            Afterwards, the amplitude for each frame is calculated using the
            various functions discussed above. This value is sent to both channels
            of each frame. Another option is available to allow different playbacks
            for each LR channel.
          </p>
          <p>
            After calculating the amplitude of a single frame, an AR function
            (from CInstrumentEffects) is called to ensure no pops are made at the
            beginning/end of output (which could have happened if m_rtime &gt; m_duration).
            Finally, m_time increases for each sample period. This frame will but giving
            to either sound output and/or file output.
