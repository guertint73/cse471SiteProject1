          <h2>Component Details</h2>
          <p>
            This component simulates the sound of a Hammond B3 Organ,
            an instrument that utilizes tonewheels (metal wheels with magnets)
            that spin and trigger a small pickup. This essentially generates a sinewave.
            The Hammond Organ utilizes several of these tonewheels to generate
            different harmonics, drawbars to adjust the gain of each harmonic,
            and several practical effects including Leslie Speakers, Vibrato, and Percussion.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The implementation of this instrument is heavily based on the
            generic implementation of ToneInstrument, where a score is read
            in through an XML file, the details are parsed, the respective
            sine waves are generated with the respective effects, and all the
            sinewaves are output to the audio stream.

          <h4>Sound wave generation through the use of Tone Wheels:</h4>
          <p>
            The organ is heavily based on the original ToneInstrument, but with
            several key components expanded upon. The first being the Tonewheels.
            Whereas ToneInstrument only utilizes a singular sine wave, the Hammond
            organ essentially utilized nine different sine waves, which act as
            multiples of the harmonic. To recreate this, the organ utilizes an
            array of sine waves, which are all independently generated. This
            allows for modular control over each harmonic through the use of drawbars.
          </p>
          <h4>Gain adjustment through Drawbars</h4>
          <p>
            Each drawbar’s position is recorded in the score file and is passed
            into the OrganInstrument as an array of integers. This is then matched
            up with an array containing the decibel value of the drawbar’s gain
            settings. Utilizing these two arrays, it is possible to increment through
            the ToneWheels array and apply a decibel-based gain to each independent
            sine wave that comprises the OrganInstrument.
          </p>
          <h4>Leslie Speaker simulated through Tremolo effect</h4>
          <p>
            The Leslie Speaker for this implementation essentially acts as a tremolo,
            varying the amplitude of the output. This is accomplished by a short
            tremolo function prior to the audio output. The function takes in a
            depth and frequency, and generates a sine wave that is relative to time.
            This is then multiplied to the output similar to the gain.
          </p>
          <h4>Envelope generation through Attack and Release:</h4>
          <p>
            The envelope generator was implemented as a simple attack/release
            function that ramps in and out the gain for the first and last
            couple milliseconds. This avoids creating notes that ‘pop’ when played.
          </p>
          <h4>Vibrato Effect</h4>
          <p>
            The vibrato effect works by varying the frequency of the generated sine wave.
             To implement this a secondary class was created based on the original
             SineWave class. Within this new ‘OrganWave’ class, a few additional
             variables were created. To properly modulate the vibrato frequency
             a variable was created as a function of the initial frequency.
             This ensured the vibrato frequency was always 1% of the initial
             frequency, regardless of what that initial frequency was set to.
             <br>
             <br>
             The other variables were a relatively straightforward implementation
             of vibrato. For example, the instantaneous frequency is a sum of the
             initial frequency, plus the depth relative to the initial frequency
             multiplied by a sine wave that varies with time and the aforementioned
             vibrato frequency.
             <br>
             <br>
             An enable toggle selects between the original
             increment value, and an increment value based on the instantaneous
             vibrato-modulated frequency.
          </p>
          <h4>Percussion Effect</h4>
          <p>
            The percussion was a relatively straightforward implementation.
            Within the OrganInstrument, if percussion is enabled and time is
            less than a few milliseconds, the frequency is set to 3 times the
            initial input frequency. This gives an extra brightness to the
            beginning of each note.
            <br>
            <br>
            All of these settings can be configured and/or toggled through the input score file.
